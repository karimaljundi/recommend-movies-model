# recommend-movies-model
Unfortuantly i cannot add the files to this reopsitory because the files are too large but you if you download the zip from the link here: https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
then click on "ml-25m.zip" to download then drag the files "ratings.csv" and "movies.csv" to the same directory you have the notebook stored. Once you have that done you can run all or run each cell to see how it comes together. In the last cell you can type in a movie name to see it's recommendations, but it has to be a valid movie e.g The Matrix
